1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    ==> During server-side routing, each time we navigate to a new Url, a new GET request is being sent to the server which responds with a new document that causes the whole page to refresh, discarding the old page.

    While using client-side routing, only some elements inside the application will be changed, preventing the whole page from refereshing.

2.  What does HTTP stand for?
    ==> Hypertext Transfer Protocol

3.  What does CRUD stand for?
    ==> C - Create
    R - Read
    U - Update
    D - Delete

4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
    ==> C(Create) - POST
    R(Read) - GET
    U(Upadate) - PUT
    D(Delete) - DELETE

5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests
    ==> Axios, JQuery, and Fetch
